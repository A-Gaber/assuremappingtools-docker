# assuremappingtools-docker
Docker Image Build for Assure Mapping tools

1. Run `sh build-docker.sh` to build the image on your system. This will build an image with name **assurmaptool**.
2. Use `./run` on the root of the repository to run the container. (This is optional but can be used as a guid for how to run the container with GUI support).
